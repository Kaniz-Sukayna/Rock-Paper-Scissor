# ✊🖐✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

This is a fun **Rock Paper Scissors** (Stone Paper Scissors) game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, inspired by the **Apna College web dev series**. The project is part of my learning with the **DevWeekend Fellowship** 🚀.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Kaniz Sukayna**, currently exploring JavaScript basics and learning how to make websites interactive. This mini game helped me understand how to build logic, update the DOM, and style elements!

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – For buttons and structure.
- **CSS3** – For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** – For handling user choices, comparing with computer choices, and showing results.

## 🗂 Files in This Project

- `index.html` – Layout and emoji buttons.
- `style.css` – Styling in asthetic theme (grey + black).
- `script.js` – Handles game logic and result display.

## 🔧 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any browser.
2. Click on 🪨 Stone, 📄 Paper, or ✂️ Scissors.
3. The computer randomly picks one too.
4. You'll see the result and the score updates instantly.

## 📸 What I Learned

- If/else logic in JS
- Random selection with arrays
- Live feedback via DOM updates
- Button styling and hover effects
